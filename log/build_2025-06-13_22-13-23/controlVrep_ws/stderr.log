[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:14 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findnlohmann_json.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "nlohmann_json", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "nlohmann_json"
  with any of the following names:

    nlohmann_jsonConfig.cmake
    nlohmann_json-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "nlohmann_json" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "nlohmann_json_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "nlohmann_json" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
